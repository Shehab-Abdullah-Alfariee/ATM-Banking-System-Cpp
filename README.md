# ATM Banking System (C++)

A simple console-based ATM Banking System built in C++.
The program allows users to log in using an account number and PIN, then perform basic banking operations such as withdraw, deposit, and balance inquiry.
All client data is stored in a local text file (Clients.txt).

## 🚀 Features

✅ 🔐 User Authentication

✅ Login with Account Number + PIN Code

✅ Validates client information from the data file

✅ Quick Withdraw money (with balance validation)

✅ Normal Withdraw money (with balance validation)

✅ Deposit money

✅ View total bank balances

✅ Persistent storage using a text file (Clients.txt)

## 🧠 What I Learned

✅ Building structured data models using C++ structs.

✅ Handling files (loading, saving, updating records) using fstream.

✅ Implementing login authentication with Account Number & PIN.

✅ Creating core ATM features: Quick Withdraw, Normal Withdraw, Deposit, and Balance Inquiry

✅ Validating user input and preventing invalid transactions.

✅ Splitting and parsing text data to build a simple file-based database.

✅ Structuring the project using modular functions for cleaner and maintainable code.

✅ Designing a simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.

## 🧬 Data Structure
Each client consists of:
- Account Number
- PIN Code
- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Account Balance

## 💸 Banking Operations,
Quick Withdraw (Predefined amounts: 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000)
Normal Withdraw (Any amount that is a multiple of 5)
Deposit Money
Check Balance
Logout

## 🗂️ Client Data Management
Structured data stored in Clients.txt
Each record includes:
Account Number
PIN
Name
Phone
Account Balance

## 💾 File Handling
Read and parse client data
Modify balances and save changes back to the file
Supports marking records for deletion (extendable)

## 🚀 How It Works
User starts the program
Program loads client data from Clients.txt

## User enters:
Account Number
PIN Code
If the credentials are correct → the main menu appears

## User selects an operation:
Quick Withdraw
Normal Withdraw
Deposit
Check Balance
Logout

Any balance update is immediately saved back to the file

## 📄 Example Data Format (Clients.txt)

- AccountNumber#//#PinCode#//#Name#//#Phone#//#Balance
- A200#//#1235#//#Shehab Abdullah#//#0536242467#//#9000

## 🔮 Possible Future Enhancements
Admin panel for managing clients
Encryption for PIN codes
Transaction history
Account creation & deletion
Multi-language support
Better UI (GUI or web interface)
